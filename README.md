# F2ResNet
Revised ResNet via FFT
In modern deep networks, vanilla convolutions, which predominantly employ fixed-scale, local operations (e.g., the widely utilized 3 Ã— 3 kernels for image-oriented tasks), have been identified as having limited efficacy in connecting distant locations within the network. This shortcoming is due to their small receptive fields, which solely consider local features for reconstruction purposes. To overcome this issue, prior models have attempted to stack additional convolutional layers; however, this approach exacerbates the execution time by increasing the number of parameters, and may even give rise to the well-known vanishing/exploding gradient problem. Consequently, we present a novel approach, dubbed F2ResNet, that integrates both ResNet and Fast Fourier Transform to effectively address the challenges associated with depth and receptive field limitations. Compared to previous models, our F2ResNet displays enhanced context-sensitivity and possesses a global receptive field. Its effectiveness has been substantiated using the ILSVRC dataset, a subset of the well-known ImageNet dataset.
